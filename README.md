# INFO0948 - Introduction to intelligent robotics

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the course "INFO0948-1 - Introduction to Intelligent Robotics"! This repository serves as a central hub for resources and information related to the project of the course. We encourage collaboration and open communication, so don't hesitate to raise issues and contribute to discussions on the [Edstem forum](https://edstem.org/) dedicated to this course.

### Project

The project is the part of the course that requires the most efforts. Your final grade will be almost entirely based on this work. By **group of three students**, you will have access to a Turtlebot and to a computer with the  softwares required to control the robot already installed. Note those robots and computers won't leave the laboratory. In order to test your code somewhere elese than in the lab, follow the instructions given in the **PC setup** folder. The guidelines and all other usefull pieces of information about the project are gathered in the **project folder**.

### PC Setup

The project is done using [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) and Python. Debugging your code with the real robot can be a tedious piece of work. For this reason, you will first develop your project using the simulation environment [Gazebo](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html). We will provide you with a example map and all the required models so that you will just have to make the robot move. If you are not familiar with Python, see the [Github page](https://github.com/glouppe/info8006-introduction-to-ai/tree/master/python-tutorial) of Professor Gilles Louppes and his INFO8006 team. They provide a good Python tutorial. The Foxy version of ROS2 requires Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa. Follow the instructions given in the **setup folder**, you will be guided through the installation of a virtual machine Ubuntu 20.04 on which ROS2 foxy and Gazebo are already installed.

### Tutorials

If it is the first time you hear about ROS2 and Gazebo, don't worry. Two introductory sessions will be given in the beginning of the semester. The first one will be dedicated to ROS2 and the way it works. We will especially focus on tf2, the tree of transforms of your robot application. The second one will introduce Gazebo and how you can simulate the Turtlebot for the project. The content related to tutorials and homework can be found in the **tutorials folder**.
